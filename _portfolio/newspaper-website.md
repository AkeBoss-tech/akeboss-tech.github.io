I was the lead developer for the [UCVTS Newspaper Club's new website](https://ucvts-campus-chronicle.com/). Our old website was hosted on WordPress and it was too clunky for our needs and wasn't very customizable. I decided to create a new website from a Jekyll template and host it on GitHub Pages. This allowed us to have a more customizable website that was easier to manage as well as host it for much cheaper.

Here is the [GitHub link](https://github.com/The-Campus-Chronicle/website/).

I quickly learned that I would need to build a lot more outside of the template to make the website work for our needs. I had to create a new layout for the homepage, change the way data was used in the structure, and create many new kinds of pages. I had to learn the Liquid template engine, Bootstrap, and brush up on my HTML and CSS skills to make the website look good. I spent countless hours adding new features and refining existing ones.

For example, I added custom main, category, authors, and article pages.

Since the website was for a newspaper club, I needed to make sure that students would know how to add articles to the website. I created a guide for students to follow to add articles to the website and made sure that the website was easy to navigate. I created videos and comprehensive guides to help students learn how to use the website. I created a GitHub organization to make it easy for students to contribute to the website.

Here is a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Uj1Jz08X1kLRDBc6Jj9cB4_aVqu3sj2PSrBlm5MK_Y8/edit?usp=sharing) with how to add articles.

Here is a tutorial I made:

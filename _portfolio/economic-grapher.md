## Inspiration
This project was made for the FED Challenge. The goal was to create a tool that would help our team graph FED and BLS data. Instead of having to download the data as CSVs and then graph it, this website does it all for us with consistent formatting.

## Description
This project uses the FRED and BLS APIs to get data and then graphs it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Initially, I just had a Python function that I ran to create graphs, but I decided to make it a Streamlit app so that it would be easier to use and share.

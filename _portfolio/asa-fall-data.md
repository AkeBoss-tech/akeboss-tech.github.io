I competed in my school's submission for the [ASA Fall Data Challenge](https://community.amstat.org/asafalldatachallenge/home) in 2023. Each year, the ASA challenges undergraduate and high school students to analyze real-world data and make recommendations to address interesting and timely topics.

> 2023's challenge:
> 
> A startup is considering developing a bootcamp for coders and people who want to work as developers. Theyâ€™ve hired your team to give them insights on their business model and want you to analyze the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

I was mainly responsible for the data analysis and visualization in this project which my team later used to recommend our conclusions.

> Here are some questions your team might consider:
> 
> * The startup has sufficient initial funding to focus on 2 languages and to initiate planning for a third. Based on your analysis of the survey results, what are your recommendations for their focus?
> * Are their demographic characteristics you believe should be considered in the decision-making process? If so what are they and why are they important?
> * What visualizations can you create to make the investors more comfortable with the plan?

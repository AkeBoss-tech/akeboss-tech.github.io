I basically created a program that could find the derivatives and integrals of most functions used in AP Calculus AB and BC. 
I programmed in several different types of function classes: for example polynomials, sin, cos, tan, ln, exponentials, and constants (I used them in my code as functions cause it was easier that way) 
I also coded the calculus rules that needed to be followed in order to find the derivative or integrals of these functions. 
Once I coded these basics, I moved on to more complicated calculus rules like the product, chain, and quotient rules (along with their integral counterparts). 
Once I had all the calculus rules working, I moved on to the quiz part of the project. 
I decided that each type of question would be multiple choice and I set out on creating realistic incorrect answers for all the calc rules. 
This in retrospect was the longest part of the project because I had to put a lot of thought into what students could make mistakes on. 
After this, I began generating the actual questions which was also difficult. 
I had to constrain the things that were generated to only have things that could be solved by an AP Calc student (even though I only taught my program AP Calculus it generated problems that were way to long like with multiple chain or quotient rule uses which isn't realistic) 
In the end, I was able to create 19 different question types (you can look through the code to see them) and a quiz program using python to ask these questions as well.
